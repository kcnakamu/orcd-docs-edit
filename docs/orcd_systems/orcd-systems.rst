ORCD Systems
============

There are several systems that ORCD provides to the entire MIT community. They all run with a Slurm scheduler 
and most have a web portal for interactive computing. These are Engaging, SuperCloud, and Satori.

Engaging
________

The Engaging cluster is open to everyone on campus. It has around 80,000 x86 CPU cores and 300 
GPU cards ranging from K80 generation to recent Voltas. Hardware access is through the Slurm 
resource scheduler that supports batch and interactive workloads and allows dedicated reservations.
The cluster has a large shared file system for working datasets. Additional compute and storage 
resources can be purchased by PIs. A wide range of standard software is available and the Docker 
compatible Singularity container tool is supported. User-level tools like Anaconda for Python, 
R libraries and Julia packages are all supported. A range of PI group maintained custom software 
stacks are also available through the widely adopted environment modules toolkit. A standard, 
open-source, web-based portal supporting Jupyter notebooks, R studio, Mathematica and X graphics 
is available at https://engaging-ood.mit.edu. Further information and support is available from 
engaging-support@techsquare.com.

Satori
______

Satori is an IBM Power 9 large memory node system. It is open to everyone on campus and has 
optimized software stacks for machine learning and for image stack post-processing for 
MIT.nano Cryo-EM facilities. The system has 256 NVidia Volta GPU cards attached in groups of 
four to 1TB memory nodes and a total of 2560 Power 9 CPU cores. Hardware access is through the 
Slurm resource scheduler that supports batch and interactive workload and allows dedicated 
reservations. A wide range of standard software is available and the Docker compatible 
Singularity container tool is supported. A standard web based portal 
https://satori-portal.mit.edu with Jupyter notebook support is available. Additional compute 
and storage resources can be purchased by PIs and integrated into the system. Further 
information and support is available at satori-support@techsquare.com.

SuperCloud
__________

The SuperCloud system is a collaboration with MIT Lincoln Laboratory on a shared facility that 
is optimized for streamlining open research collaborations with Lincoln Laboratory. The facility 
is open to everyone on campus. The latest SuperCloud system has more than 16,000 x86 CPU cores 
and more than 850 NVidia Volta GPUs in total. Hardware access is through the Slurm resource 
scheduler that supports batch and interactive workload and allows dedicated reservations. A wide 
range of standard software is available and the Docker compatible Singularity container tool is 
supported. A custom, web-based portal supporting Jupyter notebooks is available at
https://txe1-portal.mit.edu/. Further information and support is available at 
supercloud@mit.edu.
